# Sales-Insights Power BI Project

Power BI Dashboard for the sales manager of a company to help him tracking sales.





## Problem Statement
AtliQ hardware is a company in India which supplies computer hardware and peripheral devices across India only. The have many stores across India such as surge stores, Nomad stores etc. The head office of the company is situated in Delhi.

## Scenario
In order to this he has some of the regional managers in North, south and central India working for the company. So, he calls them and ask about the insights he wants to know. They tell him about the sales in last quarter and the growth in that quarter.

So, the problem is that the conversations that are happening are verbal. Hence, the regional managers are sugar coating the facts and the manager of the company does not get the clear picture of the facts. Even after knowing that the sales are declining, he cannot do anything because he does not have the clear picture of the sales. 

Asking for the records the regional manager provides him with excel files. But by this he cannot figure out small things.

All what the manager wants is a view of the weakest area the company need to focus to increase the sales and improvise the declination. He is interested in simple, understandable and digestive insight. So, he is more interested in a dashboard which he can go and look at the real data because data speaks the truth. All he wants is a simple data visualization tool which he can access on daily basis.

Hence, by using such tools and technology one can make data driven decisions which helps to increase the sales of the company.

So, in this project we will help a company make its own sales related dashboard using PowerBI.

# Data Discovery
Project planning using AIMS grid â€“
AIMS grid: It is a project management tool which consists of four components to it.

1) Purpose (what to do exactly)
2) Stack holders (who will be involved)
3) End result (what do you want to achieve)
4) Success criteria (cost optimization and time save)

In our case the end result will be the dashboard created and success criteria will be bumping up the sales using cost optimization and save the time of the manager of the company.
